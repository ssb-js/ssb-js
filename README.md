# SSB-JS

## History

The SSBC is a structureless organization that doesn't adaquately serve the needs
of participants in the Scuttlebutt ecosystem. The SSB-JS namespace is an attempt
to build a healthy organization with reliably maintained software.

Healthy organizations have healthy governance, which requires decision-making
and conflict-resolution practices available to all members. Most decisions
should be made organically from the bottom up, but decisions that change the
SSB-JS organization require discussion and consent.
